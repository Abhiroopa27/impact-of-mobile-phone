In addressing the multifaceted impact of mobile phones on children in Mohammadapuram village, it is imperative for stakeholders to adopt a proactive approach. Parents, educators, and policymakers must collaborate to establish clear guidelines for responsible mobile phone usage. This includes setting limits on screen time and encouraging alternative activities that promote physical activity and social interaction. Education about healthy technology habits should be integrated into both home and school environments, emphasizing the importance of balance and moderation. Moreover, adults should model responsible behavior by minimizing distractions and prioritizing face-to-face interactions. Utilizing technology tools such as parental control apps can aid in monitoring and regulating children's usage. Open communication channels between stakeholders are crucial for addressing concerns and providing support. Policymakers should also play a role by implementing regulations that promote digital literacy and restrict marketing practices targeting children. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of strategies based on feedback and research findings are essential for ensuring that mobile phones serve as beneficial tools while minimizing potential negative impacts on children's well-being and development.
